CTFd_anonymousChallenges
=========================
This [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/) plugin provides an 'anonymous' challenge type and injects an flag submission form on the challenges page. This provides a way for CTF organizers to use flags *without* an associated challenge placeholder/modal on the scoreboard.

## Install
Clone this repository into the CTFd plugins folder.

## Notes
* While not required, anonymous flags _should_ be unique.
